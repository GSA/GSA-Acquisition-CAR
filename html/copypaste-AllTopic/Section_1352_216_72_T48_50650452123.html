</p>
                                 <p class="p P">Based upon the quality of its performance and the results of the Government's performance evaluation, the contractor may earn an award fee.

                                 <p class="p List1">(b) A Performance Evaluation Plan shall be unilaterally established by the Government as part of the contract and used for the determination of award fees. This plan shall include the criteria that will be used to evaluate the contractor's performance and to determine the percentage of award fee (if any) available for each performance period.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(c) The criteria contained within the Performance Evaluation Plan may relate to:
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) Quality of performance of the contract requirements;

The FDO's unilateral determination of the amount of award fee earned in any evaluation period or a determination that no fee was earned shall be conclusive.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(f) The contractor may submit a self-evaluation of its performance in an evaluation period. The FDO shall consider the self-evaluation, as the FDO deems appropriate.
