All Department of Commerce security processing pertinent to this contract will be conducted at no cost to the contractor.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(4) Security processing shall consist of limited personal background inquiries pertaining to verification of name, physical description, marital status, present and former residences, education, employment history, criminal record, personal references, medical fitness, fingerprint classification, and other pertinent information. For non-U.S. citizens, the Sponsor must request an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. It is the option of the Office of Security to repeat the security processing on any contract employee at its discretion.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(e) Notification of Disqualifying Information. If the Office of Security receives disqualifying information on a contract employee, the COR will be notified.

</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts.</p>
