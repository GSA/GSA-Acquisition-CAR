</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) The following restrictions and definitions apply to prevent conflicting roles, which may bias the contractor's judgment or objectivity, or to preclude the contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List2">(1) Descriptions or definitions:

Examples include limited or restricted data, trade secrets, sensitive financial information, and computer software; and may appear in cost and pricing data or involve classified information.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(iv) “System” means the system that is the subject of this contract.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List3">(v) “System Life” means all phases of the system's development, production, or support.

The parties recognize that the contractor shall occupy a highly influential and responsible position in determining the system's basic concepts and supervising their execution by other contractors. The contractor's judgment and recommendations must be objective, impartial, and independent. To avoid the prospect of the contractor's judgment or recommendations being influenced by its own products or capabilities, it is agreed that the contractor is precluded for the life of the system from award of a DOC contract to supply the system or any of its major components, and from acting as a subcontractor or consultant to a DOC supplier for the system or any of its major components.
