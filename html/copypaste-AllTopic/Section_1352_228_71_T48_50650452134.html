         <p class="p P">As prescribed in 48 CFR 1328.310-70(c), insert the following clause:
</p>
                                 <p class="p HD1">Deductibles Under Required Insurance Coverage - Cost Reimbursement (APR 2010)
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(a) The contractor is required to present evidence of the amount of any deductibles in its insurance coverage.
</p>
                                 <p class="p List1">(b) For any insurance required pursuant to <em class="ph i">1352.228-70, Insurance Coverage,</em> the contractor's deductible is not allowable as a direct or indirect cost under this contract. The Government is not liable, and cannot be invoiced, for any losses up to the minimum amounts of coverage required in paragraphs (a) through (d) of clause 1352.228-70. If the contractor obtains an insurance policy with deductibles, the contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for any deductible amount up to the minimum amounts of coverage stated.
